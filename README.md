# Workday Interactive Planner

 This Workday Interactive Planner is a simple calendar application intended for an employee with a busy schedule. The app runs in the browser using jQuery to dynamically power the HTML and CSS. The user can add important events to the daily planner in order to manage their time effectively.

 When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. Upon scrolling down, color-coded time blocks are presented indicating whether it's in the past, present, or future. Time blocks in the past are color-coded gray, the present time block is colored red, and future time blocks are colored green. This app is updated every minute to re-color the time blocks as needed, so the user doesn't have to refresh for the colors to change as time passes.

 As the user clicks into a time block, they can enter an event and save it. Upon saving, the text input for that event is stored in local storage and will persist upon refreshing the page.
